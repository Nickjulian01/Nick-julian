What did I do well this sprint?
I was reasonably happy with the appearence of my website given the time available. I used google and the MDN documentation to solve a couple of problems which was satisfying. Developing the website allowed me to play around and re-inforce learnings from sprint-2. I delved into most of the resources which was rewarding.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
There are a couple of things that I didn't do well this sprint. I used two independent customised CSS files for my website. This doubled up some work and may lead to problems down the track. Indenting and commenting were either poor or non existent.

 What can I improve on next sprint?
 Things that I can improve include:
 -Using the pomodoro technique to improve concentration
 -Think about commenting from code
 -More note taking.
