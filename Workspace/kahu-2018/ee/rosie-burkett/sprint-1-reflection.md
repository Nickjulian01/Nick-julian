sprint-1-reflections

What did I do well in this sprint?
Blocking out good chunks of time to study, in my newly-created study area - 'setting the scene' each time I sat down and having a clear goal of what I was getting achieved in that session. This enabled me to get focussed quickly and stay focussed.

What didn't I do well this sprint?
Also time related... but this was around spending too much time on CSS. It's easy to get carried away tweaking and trying things out. For a time, I lost sight of the fact that my blog will continue to evolve and improve as I work through Phase 0. Stepping away and coming back refreshed helped me to get back on track.

What can I improve on next sprint?
Recogise when I'm spending too much time on any one task, by trying out the Pomodoro technique (or similar). The quicker I can track progress and realise if I'm getting off-track, the better.
