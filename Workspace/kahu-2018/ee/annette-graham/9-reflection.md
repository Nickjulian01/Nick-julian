1. What did I do well through my nine sprints in phase 0?
- I think I did well to finish it in the time frame that I did. And come out with a feeling of achievement. I know I put as much effort as I could into everything.

2. What could I have done to improve through these sprints?
- There were times where I was stuck on something and kept trying to solve the problem. I think if I had taken a small breaks more often during these times, it would be less tedious. Also, pseudocode. I need to do way more pseudocode in the future!

3. What learnings and habits have I developed that will help me in bootcamp?
- Taking a few moments so refocus yourself can help a great deal. Short mindfulness exercises, such as focusing on your breathing are beneficial. Fresh air is your friend! Lastly, timeboxing! It is so easy to spend hours on something you only intended to take half an hour.
