What did I do well this sprint?

Moved through tasks at quite a good pace. Found a good balance between how long I was thinking about the tasks/pseudo coding/trialling/answering and looking for hints/explaining solutions to myself. 

Found time to revise and repeat previous exercises.


What didn't I do well in this sprint?

Remembering things, though I'm not fussed by this, seeing I'm still a beginner.


What could I have done to improve?
Nothing.
