What did I do well this sprint?

I perspevered. Also drawing heavily on all my education knowledge and not getting frustrated
when things still seem a bit hazy to me or I'm unable to answer a question without looking at 
the hints. I worked steadily, took my time, wrote lots of notes, gave each challenge my best shot
and re-did challenges to see if I remembered what to do (which lets be honest I did just as many times
as I did not - but I'm okay with that.)


What could I have done to improve?

Practise, practise, practise. But there are only so many hours in a day.
