What did I do well this sprint?

Like last week. Moved through tasks at quite a good pace. Found a good balance between how long I was thinking about the tasks/pseudo coding/trialling/answering and looking for hints/explaining solutions to myself. 

Found time to revise and repeat previous exercises.

Definitely building up both an understanding of what I know and also what I don't know so I can look into things in a more refined way, than randomly hoping for an answer or eureka moment.

Nah, happy with how I worked through this sprint.


What could I have done to improve?
Revising more? But then I have another 2.5 months to do so...
