What did I do well this sprint?

I didn't give up lol As pieces of the puzzle are slowly coming together (e.g I am getting a better understanding of what I am trying to do, understanding more the language that is being used to describe what's going on) I am able to look more specifically for help within my notes or on the web. I compared my solution to those of others and learnt from that.

What could I have done to improve?

Same as last and probably each week: spent more time on each task and explore other resources. Although I managed to do so a bit this week.
