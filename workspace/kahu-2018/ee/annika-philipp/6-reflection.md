What did I do well this sprint?
Getting more comfortable with JavaScript and starting to connect the dots. Getting curious/interested instead of frustrated when things don't work out and using resources to solve problems.

What could I have done to improve?
Nothing. I'm quite happy with progress up to this stage.
