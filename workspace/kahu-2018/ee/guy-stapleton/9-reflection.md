What did I do Well
Learnt the basics of using Canvas

Where can I improve
Be more disciplined
Track time
Revisit some earlier sprints and go over concepts ahead of Bootcamp

What did I do well over Phase 0
Going beyond course materials - Learning Sketch Bassics, Font Aweome, HTML5 Canvas
Going over material to improve understanding - Array and Iterator methods

Where do I need to improve after Phase 0
Use branches and make small commits - don't make wide ranging changes across multiple files
Correcting faulty mental models - I get stuck with half baked undesanding and then stumble around with that. Need to admit whn I dodn't know something fully and worka t correcting that
Providing feedback -
Asking other for help
Validating HTML and CSS
Use a CSS Reset
The balance between doing and reflecting
