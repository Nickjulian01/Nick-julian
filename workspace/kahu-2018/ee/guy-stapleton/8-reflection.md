What did I do well
I experimented using alternatives to create the calculator (using eval and looping through an array).
I used a calculator object rather than global variables.

Where do I need to improve
I've been inconsistent with using Toggl the during Sprint 8 and 9.
I haven't been diligent with assignments since middle November (I've gotten through the work and attending checkins. However, could have worked a harder and made more progress).
