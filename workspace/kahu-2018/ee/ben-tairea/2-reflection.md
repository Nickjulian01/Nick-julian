What did i do well this week?

    I found the material fairly straight forward. I think i've got HTML structure locked down, learning to pull and push to GITHUB. 
    
What could you have done better?

    I wish i took more notes especially around the CSS frameworks as i will have to revisit some of that information if it doesnt already cover that information in future lessons.... Note to self, take more notes :)
    I had a bit of a break inbetween sprint-2. I need to improve time management.
