# What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
The journey through all these nine sprints has been a huge. There is not just one  thing which I did well, I think I have done pretty well in terms from where I started and how much my learning has shaped up during this 9 sprints.
There are still a lot of challenges ahead of me, But I feel
studying on my own and keeping motivated for so long that's the highlight of these whole nine sprints.
The learning will take it's own time as everyone has different grasping power. I feel I have given my best, coming from very different background.
# What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0?
 I should have been more patient with learning some of the concepts. It
 makes me very restless and stressed when I am unable to understand what I am reading or trying to learn.
