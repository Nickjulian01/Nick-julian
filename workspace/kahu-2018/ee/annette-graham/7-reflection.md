1. What did I do well this sprint?
- I did well with the eloquent JavaScript exercises. I manage to answer them quickly and understood them much more than I understood the last eloquent JS exercises.

2. What can I improve on next sprint?
- I didn't get far in the Free Code Camp challenges within the four hours I time boxed so I carried on for a while longer. Next time I wouldn't spend much longer than the suggested time and would come back to it after I'd finished the rest of the sprint.
