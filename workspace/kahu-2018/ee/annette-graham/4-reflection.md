1. What did I do well in this sprint?
 - I think I did well to complete it. It was a long sprint that made my brain melt at times. JavaScript was completely foreign to me. It's quite logical though, so I understood the concepts if not how to apply them.

2. What could I have done to improve?
 - I think I could have spent more time making sure I understood some of the more difficult concepts more. Getting and setting seemed difficult to me and I think I should have made sure I actually got it before I moved on.
