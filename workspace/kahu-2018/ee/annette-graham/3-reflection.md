1. What did I do well in this sprint?
  - I think I did well to redesign my entire website. I used methods and code that was completely foreign to me before last week and it all worked as I wanted them to (for the most part).

2. What could I have done to improve?
  - I couldn't get my images in the technical blog to work as I intended them to. So I need to figure that one out!
