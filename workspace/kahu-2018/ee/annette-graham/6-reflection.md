1. What did I do well on this sprint?
 - I think I did well to complete it so quickly! I worked hard on it.

 2. What could I have done to improve?
  - I feel like I need to understand some of the code I was doing more. My brother helped me on the minesweeper and I will definitely need to go back and revisit a couple of the methods we used.
