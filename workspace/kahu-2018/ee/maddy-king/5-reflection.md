Finishing it! What an enormous sprint. Very proud of solving some of the challenges which were pretty tricky. Also enjoyed taking the time to read about what I was learning from different sources to understand it better.
What could I have done to improve?
Finishing it in one week instead of three.
Finished the last Eloquent JavaScript challenge without looking at the answer.
