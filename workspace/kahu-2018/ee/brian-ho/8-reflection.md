# What did I do well this sprint?

I played mentoring role again when pair coding with Belma to work on the Sprint-8 task to help her working on calculator. While working on the Calculator myself, I did stretch goal of reproducing the feature and functionality of the standard calculator found in Window 7 operating system. 

# What could I have done to improve?

I was behind schedule in working on the cultural blog. The delay in finishing sprint-7 cultural blog also causing the delay of the sprint-8 cultural blog. While working on the stretch goal of the calculator project, my timing of sleep and wake time seems to get into chaos. It will hurt me and reduce productivity in the long run if I keep on having my sleep pattern disrupted while working on a complex project.
