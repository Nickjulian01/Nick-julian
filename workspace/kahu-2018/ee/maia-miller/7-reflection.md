What did I do well this week?

My understanding is improving a lot now, which feels really good! This helps me stay motivated as I'm working, so I've been doing a good job of being productive and moving through things at a quicker pace.

I also feel like I'm taking good notes - they're not necessarily organized, but I know where to find information and have been finding them useful when returning back to concepts.

 What could I have done to improve?

 It'd be nice to have more organized notes - I feel like later, especially, I'll wish I had that! As I mentioned above, the pace is going pretty well, but I still feel like things WILL be hard, so it can be difficult to find the motivation to sit down and focus when I believe that it'll be overwhelmingly difficult. For the final two sprints, not only do I hope to find the tasks themselves challenging but manageable, I think the key is to remember that indeed they are manageable!
