Why is reflection important?
For me reflection is not just about looking at your mistakes. To reflect is to question the things you've done and learn from them. Reflection itself is learning.  

What did I do well this sprint?
I realized that rushing isn't the way to do things. I kept forgetting to push changes on Github and couldn't figure out why my changes didn't show up on the Github repo.

What could I have done to improve?
It's almost unsettling that I barely remember anything that I learned from Code academy's online classes. I'll have to regularly practice for continous improvement and take a break so I don't fry my brain overanalysing a problem.
