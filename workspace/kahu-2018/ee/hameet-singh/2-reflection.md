What did I do well this sprint?
I think this sprint went better for me than the last one. The lessons from Udacity were very well structured and I rarely hit a block. I was able to keep a steady pace and took regular breaks so as to not to exhaust myself.

What could I have done to improve?
I should have given more time and played around with a bit more with css but I played it safe.
