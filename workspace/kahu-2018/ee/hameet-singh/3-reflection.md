What did I do well this sprint?
I solved almost all of my problems other than linking and styling the images in css. I went and checked code indentation a lot but I kept hitting blocks after a while. As always I've had to find solutions myself by mostly just hit and trial.

What could I have done to improve?
I've done a lot, I don't think I could do more in the time I have.
