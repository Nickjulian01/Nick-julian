What did I do well this sprint?
I actally enjoyed some of the Javascript stuff as I've always liked math until it gets too complex. When it works for you it's great, when it doesn't you feel like pulling your hair out. 

What could I have done to improve?
I should have made more notes but I'll do that when I deal with future javascript assignments.
