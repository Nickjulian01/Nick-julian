Why is reflection important?

"Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." - Albert Einstein."

I see reflection as my opportunity to ensure I am taking the time to go over what I've done and how I've approached things to understand what went well and what I can improve on.
It stops me from going insane.

What did I do well this sprint?

I found I was extremely resourceful in finding solutions in this sprint.  I came across some very annoyingly frustrating problems.  My solution process is: 
1. Go backwards step by step to figure out what went wrong until I did (This gave me good practice in terminal - win win).  
2. If I was blocked, I went to reference material and instead of trying to solve the problem I was having - I put myself in a 'learning' mindset as I went through the reference material.
Once I was done, I was able to figure out the  solution by learning the overall content than focusing in on one point.  I'll need to remember this going forward.


What could I have done to improve?

I need to timeblock any work I do in CSS.  I'm very visual and because I felt like my webpage is stuck in the 90's, I spent so much time trying to learn how to make it look pretty that I ended up biting the bullet and moving on with the next task.
My CSS skill will improve with time.  I need to remember to give myself that time to learn.
