SPRINT 2 Reflection

What did I do well in this sprint?

Technical learning aside, I did well to maintain self discipline and manage my time effectively.  
I wasn't feeling well in the first half of the week which meant I missed 3 days of study.  When you combine time delays with the difficult content I needed to get my head around I found this sprint challenging.  I had to fight tendencies to just move through tasks for the sake of completing it in time and focus on learning.  I really had to pull myself back.  I'm glad I did though.  
(FYI as I write this I know I still have Task 2.5 to complete.  I need to reflect in order to go back and tackle that problem again.  My way of venting.  I hope that's okay.)

What I didn't do well this sprint?

I think I covered that in my explanation above but to add to it, as a result of my unforeseen time delays - instead of doing what I did with Sprint-1 where I balanced my day with a walk and fresh air before I started study, to make up for lost time in this sprint I didn't do my walks and went straight into study.  I definitely felt the difference. I need to make sure I prioritise this daily ritual because I'm more productive as a result of it.

What will on improve on next sprint?

1. Prioritise getting fresh air and exercise to start my day (I'm more productive this way).
2. Prioritise learning over smashing through a task (Note to self: it's about finding a balance).
3. Remember Engie - Trust the process!!
4. Two minutes of mindfulness before I go to bed.
