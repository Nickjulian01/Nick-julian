This was a very practical sprint that I had to apply things learnt into real codes and it was really hard. It is quite easy to understand functioning code but it is not as easy to write code that works by yourself. During the minesweeper challenge, I was panic to discover there were so many small things I did not know about. This is really something that I have to pay attention to. I think I will have to pay more time read and analyse codes that work to learn from them.
