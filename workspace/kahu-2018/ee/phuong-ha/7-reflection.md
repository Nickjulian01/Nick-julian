I spent much longer than the suggest 4 hours on Freecodecamp basic algorithm challenges but it really worth it. Although this sprint I had a lot of distractions due to Christmas and New Year and fell behind time management habit developped in previous sprints, I feel pleased as truly understand the concept and be able to figure out algorithms by myself. That feeling is sooo gooood! ^^
