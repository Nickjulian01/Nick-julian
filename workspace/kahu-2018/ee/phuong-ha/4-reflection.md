The content covered in this week was quite intensive and it took me much more than the suggested time to finish both Codecademy and Free Code Camp Javascript tutorial. Maybe it was because I tried to take notes of every new concept and there were quite a lot of them. I managed to stay focused and finished the sprint in less than 1 week which was a progress to my previous time management issue.
