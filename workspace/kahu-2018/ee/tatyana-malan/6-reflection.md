##Sprint 6 Reflection


#What did I do well this week?

This week I think I knocked the first few assignments out of the park! I was able to commandeer javascript
with an efficiency that I found pleasantly surprising. It was very satisfying to make a functional game. 

 #What could I have done to improve?

 Again, I found myself baffled by my own time management. I got done with the majority of the sprint surprisingly fast, as I was in a productive sort of mood, but then procrastinated finishing off the sprint 
 for quite some time. Overall I am still trying to figure out how to decypher my productivity rhythms.
