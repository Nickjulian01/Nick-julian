##Sprint 5 Reflection


#What did I do well this week?

I think I was quite efficient with making my cultural and tech blogs this week, and also with the debugging exercise. I found it nice to get my first real taste of javascript in action, with some of the earlier tasks
this sprint. I think I effectively managed to implement changes to the DOM and learnt a lot about event handling.


 #What could I have done to improve?

 My time management with this sprint has been really poor. It's taken me longer than any other sprint, partially
 due to tech issues (my computer broke and I had to send it in) and partially due to other circumstances at home.
 I won't let this get in the way of my progress though! finishing this sprint has only made me more determined to
 take on the next sprints with renewed vigour.
