##Sprint 7 Reflection


#What did I do well this week?

This week I worked really hard on the code camp javascript problems, and I feel that I made enormous progress in my understanding of javascript. I now feel confident reading through code that I haven't written, and being able
to understand it without an explanation. I also feel that I have made a shift from coding because I have to, to coding because I want to, and learning more because I am genuinely interested rather than because I think it is necessary. I enjoyed this week's cultural blog too, and learning about higher order functions. 

 #What could I have done to improve?

 I could have had better time management, as always. I could also have given myself way more time to look into this sprint, as I feel there are things I could have delved way deeper into and would like to return to at some point. I feel like perhaps if given more time I could have used less hints for the code camp problems.
