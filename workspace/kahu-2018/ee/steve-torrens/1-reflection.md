Why is reflection important?
Reflection is important as it is a key ingredient in the whole learning process along with experience and making mistakes. Reflection enables the student to move what has been recently learned from short term memory to long term memory. It enables people to start to understand why things went right (or wrong) and to draw conclusions and knowledge from their experience. Without reflection life would be a series of unconnected episodes with limited prospect for learning or improvement.
