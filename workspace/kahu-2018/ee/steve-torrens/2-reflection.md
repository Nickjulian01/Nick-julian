What did I do well this sprint?
I had a play around with the presentation of my blogs, using a grid and changing around the syles. This helped reinforce the material learnt in the udacity courses. I also worked out that I have been massively over commiting on my https://steve-dev90.github.io. I am now testing everying in chrome before I commit (a really beginners mistake, I guess). Also I have started to improve the meaningfulness of my commit messages.   

What didn't I do well this sprint?
I think I should have spent more time ahead of the sprint going through the resource material. I didn't like my cultural blog. It ended up just being a bit of a laundry list.  

What can I improve on next sprint?
I would like to try keeping on with minimising the number of commits, improving my commit messages, going through the resources a bit more thoroughly ahead of the exercises and going for prose in the cultural blogs.
