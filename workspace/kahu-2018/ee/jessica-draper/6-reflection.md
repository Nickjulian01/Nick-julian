What did i do well this sprint?
I think i had a lot more focus and spent a lot more time in the zone for this sprint.  I investigated a lot more things which helped instead of just stopping at a barrier and getting frustrated. 
What could i have done to improve?
I was quite stressed about the workload this week and so i could have probably tried ot do something that would calm me down and give me a bit more of a clear headspace.
