<b>What did I do well through my nine sprints in Phase 0</b>
<br>
You know, I was not sure that I would actually finish Phase 0, I didn't think I was capable of doing my own project in JS without freaking out, so I procrastinated, went back and did some of sprint 4, and I DID THE THING! Thats basically what I did well through Phase 0. I am proud of how I completed all of the assignments, and tried my best to understand all of the concepts.

<b>What could I have done to improve through my nine sprints in Phase 0</b>
<br>
You know, I feel like maybe in a week or two I could look back and answer this question, but I am not really wanting to critique myself, I am more wanting to congratulate myself on my achievements. I think I could go back and do some of the assignments again, i.e the calculator and minesweeper would be a good one to repeat, and focusing more on the CSS stuff would have solidified some knowledge, I want to go back and learn some more bootstrap, what I got out of bootstrap in the earlier sprints was super useful but I have lost it all now..
