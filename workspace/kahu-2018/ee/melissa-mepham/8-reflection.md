<b>What did I do well this week?</b>
<br>
At this stage, all I can say that I did well was finish it..

<b>What could I have done to improve?</b>
<br>
This was a really hard sprint. I struggled my way through it, and really struggled with this feeling of worthlessness. I have been MASSIVELY struggling with a negative self-image and I have not been working hard enough to change that. I just want some relief. But I also know that over the next two months I am not going to get that, and if I do quit (which is just not an option) I would be struggling with a feeling with a lack of direction. So I know this is a loose loose situation, and all I need to do is give myself permission to love myself and be kind.
